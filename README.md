# PICCOLO: Point-Cloud Centric Omnidirectional Localization
Official PyTorch implementation of **PICCOLO: Point-Cloud Centric Omnidirectional Localization (ICCV 2021)** [[Paper]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Kim_PICCOLO_Point_Cloud-Centric_Omnidirectional_Localization_ICCV_2021_paper.html) [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-_lEsChfoE).

PICCOLO is a simple, efficient algorithm for omnidirectional localization.
It estimates camera pose given a set of input query omnidirectional image and point cloud: no additional preprocessing / learning is required.
In this repository, we provide the implementation and instructions for running PICCOLO. 
If you have any questions regarding the dataset or the baseline implementations, please leave an issue or contact 82magnolia@snu.ac.kr.
